      <description>Background In my previous post I described a high level initial cluster architecture based on k3s, where we&amp;rsquo;ll use k3sup for installation, kube-vip to setup a VIP-ip for the kubernetes API and for loadbalancing services of type LoadBalancer, ingress-nginx for ingress which will get an external IP from the loadbalancer and NFS for persistent volume claims.
Setup The starting point is 7 virtual machines with Ubuntu-server 22.04, 6 of which will create the k3s cluster of 3 control-planes and 3 worker nodes.</description>

      <description>High level cluster architecture This post will describe the k3s-cluster architecture, what components I will use and which steps I have to take before I can get ArgoCD up and running for Gitops. The goal is to do as few manual steps as possible until ArgoCD is installed and everything can be moved to git and a gitops approach.
To be able to setup and access ArgoCD I need persistent storage.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my blog. In this blog I will document what I do when I have some time to spare trying out different open source software.
Last year I built my own server from used parts which I purchased on ebay. It&amp;rsquo;s a dual cpu motherboard with two intel Xeon e5 2680 v4 each with 14 cores and 28 threads, 512 GB DDR4 ECC ram and 2 TB SSD disk, running VmWare ESXI for virtualization.</description>
