      <description>Background In my previous post, I described a high-level initial cluster architecture based on k3s. We will be using k3sup for installation, kube-vip to set up a VIP IP for the Kubernetes API and load balancing services of type LoadBalancer. We will also use ingress-nginx for ingress, which will obtain an external IP from the load balancer. Finally, NFS will be used for persistent volume claims.
Setup The starting point is 7 virtual machines with Ubuntu Server 22.</description>

      <description>High level cluster architecture This post will describe the k3s-cluster architecture, what components I will use and which steps I have to take before I can get ArgoCD up and running for Gitops. The goal is to do as few manual steps as possible until ArgoCD is installed and everything can be moved to git and a gitops approach.
To be able to setup and access ArgoCD I need persistent storage.</description>
